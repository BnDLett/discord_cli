# discord_cli
Discord that is shoved down in to a minimalistic CLI. Work in progress.

Current version: a0.0.2

# Features
1. Send and receive messages on Discord from a CLI rather than the slow and clunky Discord app and website.

# Pros
1. Faster, and can be ran on a potato.
2. Uses mostly built-in libraries.
3. Doesn't rely on JS

# Cons
1. Navigation is convoluted, requiring you to know the channel ID's beforehand.
2. You need to know your Discord UUID.
3. It is in alpha, meaning there <b>will</b> be bugs.
4. Development is slow
5. No log-in save feature (yet).

I intend to fix most of the issues listed above.

Disclaimer: This was created as an alternative/fallback to the regular Discord app, I do not intend for this to be a replacement for the Discord app nor should it be a replacement to the app. Discord is not affiliated with me, nor have they said they support this project. I can not promise this project can remain up-to-date.
